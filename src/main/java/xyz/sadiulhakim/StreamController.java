    /**
     * Overview of InputStreamResource
     * Purpose: InputStreamResource is a convenient way to represent a data source as an InputStream in Spring. It allows you to stream the content of large files directly to the client without loading the entire file into memory.
     * Use Case: It is particularly useful for sending large files (like images, videos, or large datasets) or generating dynamic content on-the-fly without the need to store it entirely in memory.
     *
     * Key Features
     * Streaming: Allows for the progressive reading of data from a resource (like a file) as it's being sent to the client. This is beneficial for handling large files that may not fit into memory.
     * Memory Efficiency: Since it streams the data directly from an InputStream, it minimizes memory usage, making it suitable for applications where memory resources are constrained.
     * Content-Type Support: You can easily set the content type and headers, allowing you to serve files with appropriate MIME types.
     *
     * When to Use InputStreamResource
     * Large Files: When you need to send large files (like media files, documents, or reports) to clients, and you want to avoid loading the entire file into memory.
     * Dynamic Content: When generating content dynamically, such as CSV reports or other formats, where data is produced incrementally.
     * File Downloads: Ideal for implementing download functionality in web applications, where files can be sent as an HTTP response.
